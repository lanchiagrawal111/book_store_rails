What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a skeletal blueprint or framework that outlines the basic design and functions of a user interface (such as a website or application). 

The goal of a wireframe is to quickly and easily communicate: 

The contents of the page
The page structure and layout
The appâ€™s functions
In other words, a wireframe describes the basic structure, functions, and content of the page. 

Wireframes can be low-fidelity or high-fidelity, depending on your needs and preferences. A low-fidelity wireframe is often sketched out on paper or a whiteboard and is a useful way to brainstorm the basic outline for your design. A high-fidelity wireframe has more detail and may include simple workflows and interactions.

What is a mockup?
A mockup is the next, more in-depth iteration of the wireframe outline. A mockup is a static wireframe that includes more stylistic and visual UI details to present a realistic model of what the final page or application will look like. 

A good way to think of it is that a wireframe is a blueprint and a mockup is a visual model. 

A mockup typically includes additional visual details such as:

Colors, styles, graphics, and typography
Styled buttons and text
Navigation graphics
Component spacing
Mockups are useful tools for understanding and communicating what the final interface should look like and gives stakeholders a chance to preview design and style choices before committing to building the app in a functional prototype.
